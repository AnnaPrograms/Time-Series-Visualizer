# Page Time-Series-Visualizer
A simple program that shows the progress of a website gaining views with multiple different graphs 

 I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations are to understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
